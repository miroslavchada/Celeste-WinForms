# Celeste: Fan-made WinForms Remake

Disclaimer: very terrible code, not recommended to replicate. It serves as a time capsule of my high school years :)

### The original readme after the project was completed:

This is my first experience with game development. I did this for my high school project. I didn't know anything about it at the beginning, so some parts of the code are unnecessarily complicated, but you learn by doing :D.

I'm leaving the code as opensource, so you can get inspired or solve a problem with the game in Forms.

I'm glad to have this project behind me and I'm going to look further into Unity and game development, it's something that really got me interested.

Special thanks to my friend [Simpanzique](https://github.com/Simpanzique), who I worked with in parallel (on a similar school assignment) so we were able to be faster in development, and also to the team around the original Celeste game, which I was very excited about and decided to remake. Thank you.
